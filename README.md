# Buzzes and Crawls

Buzzes and Crawls (BaC) is a Fabric 1.21.5 mod adding more insects and other little crawlies to Minecraft.
It's made for the [Mod Garden: Nature](https://modgarden.net/events/mod-garden/nature) mod jam. 

## Planned features

Keep in mind that this list is tentative and subject to lots of changes!

### Insects that interact with the ecosystem

- [ ] Bees (the vanilla ones) and butterflies pollinate flowers and saplings, causing them to grow and spread
  - [ ] Butterflies have favorite flowers, and some species might only pollinate a single flower species!
  - [ ] Bees "dance" in real life, so I want to implement an easter egg referencing this
- [ ] Potato beetles eat your potato crops
  - [ ] You can scare them away or use insecticide (you monster!)
- [ ] Ants (They are lovely little creatures but so complex ðŸ™ƒ)
  - [ ] Spawn from naturally occurring anthills
  - [ ] Pick up leaf litter and dropped items from around the anthill
    - [ ] Several ants are required for heavier things
    - [ ] Leaf litter lets ants expand their anthill
    - [ ] Extract items ants don't require from anthills (hoppers?)
  - [ ] Will get mad at you for attacking them or the anthill, swarming you
  - [ ] Pheromone trails? (This would be a stretch goal, as it's pretty complicated to implement)
  - [ ] Possibly ants reproduce on their own:
    - [ ] According to how much food they found
    - [ ] According to the size of their nest
  - [ ] I'd LOVE to have ant farms, but not sure if/how that'd fit into the overall theme

### "Cosmetic" creatures

- [ ] "LIZARDS LIZARDS LIZARDS" -Akarys (based)
- [ ] Possibly praying mantises
